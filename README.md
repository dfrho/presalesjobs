[Deployed](https://presales-jobs.netlify.app/) 

## üìã Use Case

The app uses an [Airtable as a backend data source](https://airtable.com/shrUMXSVTl2lMjIHb/tblhJ4d44919opKsl) to publish a job board for pre-sales engineers. The Airtable is maintained by an outside source but it allows for public syncing, so a copy was created that will update whenever the base does, and an API key was obtained to pull data from it.

## CMS Solution

In addition to the job board, the app also has other content, such as information about the app and author bio, that needs to be updated on the fly. For this, Hygraph was used as a federated GraphQL API as a headless CMS solution. It pulls the data from the Airtable into their platform, making it simple to drop all the content into the frontend code using a very simple and declarative query syntax.

## Tech Stack/Architecture

The application uses a GraphQL API to retrieve data from Hygraph's Headless CMS, which serves as the content management system for the log. The application is deployed and hosted on Netlify, a cloud computing platform that empowers frontend engineers to build apps without extensive DevOps or backend involvement using Composable Architecture. Netlify hosts the server-side rendered pages in the cloud, mostly on AWS, and pulls the content from Hygraph during each build.

## üåê REST API

The Airtable REST API was used to retrieve the data from the Airtable. Here is the AirTable documentation for their API. Once you have a workspace, it will show at the bottom of the screen and you can jump into it and its documentation and API playground for testing the endpoint.

## Tutorial

[This helpful tutorial](https://hygraph.com/blog/job-aggregator-with-no-backend-code) was used to connect the REST API source to the Hygraph Schema. The article outlines the step-by-step workflow for connecting a REST API source to your Hygraph Schema, even though Next.js, not Svelte, was used as a front-end framework.

## üí° Version 2.0

A future version of the app would be possible after upgrading the Hygraph account so multiple Remote Sources can be used. This would allow streaming data from a second jobs board, ["Who's Still Hiring?"](https://stillhiring.today/) into the API and displaying these jobs after de-duping somehow.

## Secure HTML

The app uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render content from Hygraph, so it needed to be sanitized using `DOMPurify`. Notably, a helper method was added so it didn't sanitize the `target="_blank"` on the `<a>` tags, allowing a new tab to open when clicking on links.

## üìä PostHog Analytics

A privacy banner notice was implemented, with PostHog analytics activated only on user acceptance. Requires `.env` and Netlify build Environment Variable with your PostHog key: `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_ID`.

## Images Tweak

To allow access to Hygraph CMS images, `next.config.js` required this adjustment of adding the `images` property:

```jsx
module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({
  images: {
    domains: ['media.graphassets.com'],
  },
```

## ü§ñ AI-Generated Logo

Looka was used for nifty AI-generated logo design.

## Summary: 

Hygraph is a very powerful and easy-to-use platform for generating static content-driven sites, assuming you know a front-end framework and GraphQL. The Hygraph content screens are very easy to navigate for a non-coder and built for your cross-functional partners in Product and UI.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, you can clone the repository to your local machine and run the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm start`

This will install the required dependencies and start the development server. You can then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

You will need a free Hygraph application duplicating the <b>post</b> schema you see in the GraphQL queries in `index.js` and `[slug].js`. Remember to have entries and publish them in your Hygraph dashboard. Use your GraphQL API Playground in Hygraph to test your queries. Adjust the endpoint in both instances to the <b>PUBLIC</b> API Hypgraph endpoint that is <b>READ ONLY</b>. 


## Technology Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - a React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - a query language and runtime for APIs that provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to REST APIs. Very easy to request and drop data in from any backend.
- [Hygraph Headless CMS](https://hygraph.io/) - a federated GraphQL API-powered headless content management system that makes building and running a content-driven application seamless for frontend engineers and product/UI teams.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - a cloud computing platform that provides web hosting, serverless functions, CI/CD and innovations like branch deployment for easy approvals.

## Work in Progress

Expect enhancements:
- Getting all tags functionality,
- and cleaning up the hard-coded content functionality. 

We are essentially unconnecting the mdx blog posts and housing and creating them in Hygraph, making this a product that can be run by non-coders after initial launch. Low code maintenance!
